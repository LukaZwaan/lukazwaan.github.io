My main area of research is Poisson geometry. I am particularly interested in Poisson manifolds of compact types and Hamiltonian actions.

Click [here](/files/CV_LukaZwaan.pdf) to look at my CV.

I am co-organising the [Poisson 2026 conference](https://wis.kuleuven.be/events/2026_poisson/conference_poisson2026), held in Leuven on August 10-14, 2026.
